# ChampionSuggestionsBot v1.0b

==== Introduction ====

The Champion Suggestions Bot is a Reddit bot that gives user suggestions on which champions to play for Riot Games' hit moba game, League of Legends. The bot retrieves the player's information using the Riot API, analyze the information and compare it with hundreds of thousands of other players, then make recommendations based on the analysis.

The bot is based on item-item regression that is commonly seen in recommendation engines. It is similar to, for example, how Amazon.com will give you suggestions on other items to buy when you place an item in your cart. It is designed to give the best suggestions possible while pushing the player to be a little more adventurous.

==== What's New ====

Version 0.1: was a reddit bot I made 4 years ago.
Version 1.0b: completely refactored, models are updated and improved. Bot runs as a discord bot instead.

==== How to Use ====

Currently the bot is only available on my own discord server (open invite here: https://discord.gg/ypqdHhA). If you would like to have the bot on your server, feel free to contact me for a bot invite link.

You may also PM the bot if you wish to be more discrete.
